- Need to update to include the idea of showing all the books in a Series
Object. This means a detail view for series as well as books. So now we're
looking at a four or five view app as we'll want to separate capture from
Book Object Detail View as well. Capture view enables shooting a photo to
add a book to a collection. Capturing may create or extend a Series Object
and well as alway create a Book Event. The new list of views are: Capture,
Book Detail, Timeline, Summary, and Series Overview.

- Include the price paid and the estimated current value of a collected
book. Update Detail and Summary Views to report on costs and value. This
points to the need for an overview of the collection which could include it's
total count, cost, and value.

- Hide toolbar when returning from detail view to summary view.
- Enable swiping between books in detail view.
- When returning to summary view from detail view the changed based to a book should persist.
- Implement camera in detail view to take or use a photo of a comic book cover.
- Implement delete in detail view to remove a book from a series.
- Implement add in detail view to add a book to a series.
- Implement series view to view and edit a series.
- Implement add in summary view to add a book to a series.
- Implement add series action in summary view.
- Create a placeholder comic book cover for each of the major publishers plus an indy cover.

## In progress
