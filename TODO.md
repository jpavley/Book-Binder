### How to integrate issue number, era, and series?

Since comic book publishers keep starting over from issue 0, series are grouped into eras by date ranges. 
Doctor Strange includes 8 eras. Some times the series have different titles but often they don't. Sometimes 
the numbers continue between eras but more often they don't. The 7th series uses a "legacy" numbering 
scheme that Marvel may or may not abondon.
