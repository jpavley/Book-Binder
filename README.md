manifestations of art and culture printed, pressed, burned, recordered, pressed, or otherwise available to hold in
your hand then Book Binder might be for you. Open source, MIT license. Written in Swift for iOS 11 and beyond.

Just getting started. Not much to see. If you'd like to contribute reach out on Twitter to @jpavley.

- Uses camera, AR, and ML to aid in the collection management process
- Connected to a shared DB in some cloud (still figuring out the whole backend end)
- Infer metadata from shooting a picture of a book or published object
- If the book is part of series or multiple volumes Book Binder should help you discover what is missing
- Records your personal rating and feeling about a book
- Social sharing
